fcgi Scripts
-------------------------

There are a couple of simple fcgi C programs here:

* Clock: A simple program which prints the solar seconds since the epoch as a double in plain text.
* jsonp: A program which is compiled to pass the json file at a particular path through a jsonp request. A sample makefile is included.

There are several jQuery powered html/javascript pages which can depend on the jsonp fcgi script or on logs.php
